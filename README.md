JSCardsBlackJack
================

A little JavaScript experimentation project. Building a BlackJack game purely in JS.

Security is not currently an issue. Nor is design. The Bootstrap library is implemented in order to provide a platform for future GUI.

At the moment I'm using CoffeeScript's base function to bind objects in prototype with inheritance. But I'm not actually using CoffeeScript because my aim is to experiment with JS and jQuery.
